# Why Formkl?

## The problems

Form is an essential module in any web application. It is used to collect data from users. There're so many ways to create a form, plus they come in different styles and the collected data has different structures.

**Management applications** tend to have a lot of forms for CRUD operations. The more forms you have, the more time you spend on creating them. And the more time you spend on creating them, the less time you spend on developing the core features of your application.
