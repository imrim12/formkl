## What is FORMKL?

FORMKL is a markup language for creating forms, an open-source DSL (Domain Specific Language) to define form schemas and generate the corresponding HTML code. It is designed to be easy to learn and use, and to be consistent and highly readable as natural language.

## Learn about features

⚡️ Build forms in seconds

🍡 Mutiple responses

💪 Validation using operations and regex

💄 Styling with Element Plus

🎨 Custom themes

## Demo

You can visit the playground here: https://sandbox.formkl.org/

## Basic example

Install the parser

```bash
# install the package
npm install formkl

# with yarn
yarn add formkl

# with pnpm
pnpm add formkl
```

```javascript
import FormklParser from "formkl";

const yourFormklSyntax = `
  formkl {
    "Personal Information"includes {
      "Fullname" text;
      "Bio" paragraph;
    }
  }
`;

const parsedForm = FormklParser.parse(yourFormklSyntax);
```

The above formkl will be parsed into

```json
{
  "model": "flat",
  "method": "",
  "endpoint": "",
  "title": "",
  "description": "",
  "sections": [
    {
      "title": "Personal Information",
      "key": "personal-information2",
      "multiple": false,
      "fields": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "label": "Fullname",
          "require": false,
          "key": "fullname",
          "multiple": false
        },
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "label": "Bio",
          "require": false,
          "key": "bio",
          "multiple": false
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This piece of JSON can be rendered into UI using our Formkl Adapter
Or you can just use this to implement your own render logic.

## Techstack

We are currently working on Vue 3 support. React and Svelte support will be available soon.

<script setup>
  import ButtonCard from "/components/ButtonCard.vue";
  import VueLogo from '/components/icons/Vue.vue';
  import ReactLogo from '/components/icons/React.vue';

  const frameworks = [
    {
      name: "Vue 3",
      image: VueLogo,
      link: "/installation/vue",
    },
    {
      name: "React",
      image: ReactLogo,
      link: "/installation/react",
    },
  ]
</script>

<div class="frameworks-container">
  <a :href="framework.link" v-for="framework in frameworks">
    <ButtonCard>
      <template #image>
        <component :is="framework.image"></component>
      </template>
      <template #title>
          {{ framework.name }}
      </template>
    </ButtonCard>
  </a>
</div>

<style>
  .frameworks-container {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    gap: 1rem;
  }
</style>
